Building  digital twins of Indian road networks for realistic traffic simulations using MATLAB, Simulink, and RoadRunner. Model unique features like potholes and erratic driving. Create toolsets to streamline modeling for urban planning and crisis response.

Overview

This project addresses the challenges of urban traffic simulation in Indian cities by developing innovative toolsets and workflows to create detailed digital twins of road networks. Current urban planning software often fails to account for the unique complexities of Indian roadsâ€”such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors. Our solution aims to streamline the modeling process using MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and generative AI, enabling traffic management agencies to simulate realistic scenarios for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning.

Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion in India is exacerbated by the limitations of existing modeling tools, which assume ideal road conditions typical of developed countries. Manually incorporating dynamic Indian road features into digital twins is time-consuming and resource-intensive. This project seeks to accelerate the creation of high-fidelity road network models by providing:





Automated asset libraries for Indian road features.



Templates and workflows leveraging generative AI.



Seamless integration with MATLAB-based simulation environments.

Features





Automated Road Feature Modeling: Incorporate potholes, barricades, and construction zones using RoadRunner asset libraries.



Data Integration: Import and process OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for Hyderabad and other Indian cities.



Scenario Generation: Create programmatic driving scenario variations with the Automated Driving Toolbox.



Hyper-Local Simulation: Model erratic driving behaviors and dynamic road conditions in Simulink.



Extensibility: Compatible with MATLAB and MathWorks tools for future enhancements.
